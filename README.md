Genetic-Neural-Network
======================

This is a genetic algorithm that evolves a neural network to play a simple game. The game is a simple 2D car that has to avoid obstacles. The neural network is a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer. The neural network is evolved using a genetic algorithm.
